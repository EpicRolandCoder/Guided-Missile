# Guided-Missile
My first HTML game where two players control squares.

**Summary**
The aim of the game is for the orange square to hit the blue square and score a point.
If either of the squares touch the boundaries of the map, their opponent gains a point.
The orange square is smaller and faster than the blue square, BUT if it begins to travel
in a certain direction (e.g. up) then it can not travel in the opposite direction (down)
until a point has been scored. Additionally, the orange square can not stop moving.

**Controls**
Blue: WASD
Orange: Arrow Keys

*Notes*
Many find it much easier to be blue than orange. To make the game more even, keep track
of how many points each player gets as orange before swapping once blue reaches 50 points.
